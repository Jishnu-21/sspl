His insightful suggestions have really helped me a lot to improve my technical capabilities. However, I feel that I could have learned/ worked on various other projects if my first 3 weeks would have not been taken by Arbutus Analyzer software training. In the later one month, I worked on designing visually interactive and insightful PowerBI dashboard. I would also take this opportunity to thank Mr. Siddhant Kumar to patiently guide me by giving fruitful suggestions. At last, I would like to express my gratitude to Ms. Shveta for giving me this opportunity to intern at SSPL.',

I got to work with real sales data, and my data was particularly interesting because it was very recent and it was the first experimental data collected in its geographical area. Being in a management environment, I learned a lot more here about my academic interests than I did when I interned in industry. I learned a lot from this internship, especially on how to use the sales data in an effective manner & there is a huge gap between the skill required for the industry and what we got from our theoretical subjects. I would like to pay thanks to our Institute who gave me a wonderful opportunity to intern for SSPL.',

We all know that practical experience is the best, and internships give students that hands-on experience they need. I feel that quality internships are essential to develop key skills that you cant get in a classroom. Skills such as multitasking, communicating, learning to deal with diversity, and dealing with deadlines are different when you are working for someone else, not yourself like you do in college. I learned that customer dealing is tough. I have learned that stressing over little things will not get me anywhere. I have learned to work well as a team. I have learned to ask lots of probing questions. Thank you so much Sonal mam.',

I have learned a lot of things such as learn each day how to work for 8 hours with masti and complete the work on time. Under the guidance of Priyanka Maâ€™am, I had learned how to deal in corporate environment with ease and how to tackle the work in any situation and respond the person in a friendly way. Under the guidance of Nishith Sir, I had learned how to deal with the work like how to visualize the things, first create the imagination and write it down and then create the visualization on Tableau.',

Another aspect that I had learned throughout my internship is to never be afraid to ask lots of questions.

Also learnt how to deal with live projects, and give proper naming and structure to the project. Whenever I stuck during any project, then Priyanka Maâ€™am helps me to understand the technical things and also helps me by giving multiple solutions to one problem. So this internship give me a lot of things which I cannot imagine as I have got friendly colleagues, a good mentor (Priyanka Maâ€™am and Nishith Sir) who guides me how to deal in any situation and also gives solution whenever needed. So, this experience is my asset and it would be increased in future also.',
